# LondonMarathon <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" width="120" />

An R package containing two data sets scraped from Wikipedia (last scraped 6 April 2025) on London Marathon winners, and general data. The two data sets can be joined by `Year`.

## Installation

Install using:

```
remotes::install_github("nrennie/LondonMarathon")
```
Load the data sets with:

```
data(winners, package = "LondonMarathon")
data(london_marathon, package = "LondonMarathon")
```

> To make it easier to work with the `Time` column in the `winners` date, we suggest also installing the `chron` package. If not installed, the times will be displayed as a decimal (representing the fraction of 24 hours).
